Flow of Bot Code
1. Within UpdateGameState (farkle-flask-comms.py) calls "doOneBotStep" (play-farkle.js)
2. doOneBotStep (play-farkle.js) calls rollDice (farkle-flask-comms.py) or doBotPolicy (farkle-flask-comms.py)
3. doBotPolicy (farkle-flask-comms.py) calls Python Server then implementPolicy (play-farkle.jx)
4 implementPolicy (play-farkle.js) calls rollDice (farkle-flask-comms.py) or bankScore (farkle-flask-comms.py)
